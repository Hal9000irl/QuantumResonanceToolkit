# Quantum Resonance Toolkit

A team-built platform for simulating quantum effects in biological systems, using chaos models and bio-resonant frequencies. Ideal for modeling neural quantum processes (e.g., Orch-OR-inspired) and human-AI fusion.

## Features
- Chaos-driven simulations (Lorenz attractors) to perturb quantum states.
- Bio-resonance integration (e.g., 528 Hz drive) for coherence enhancement.
- Basic quantum operations for entanglement demos (~0.4 fusion strength).
- Mock EEG input for bio-signal compatibility.

## Installation
1. Install dependencies: `pip install qutip numpy scipy matplotlib`
2. Clone repo: `git clone [your-repo-url]`
3. Run: `python chaos_quantum_sim.py` or `python eeg_quantum_demo.py`

## Usage
- Run `chaos_quantum_sim.py` for chaos-quantum demo.
- Run `eeg_quantum_demo.py` for EEG mapping example.
- Outputs: Plots and metrics (e.g., fusion strength).

## Benchmarks
- Achieves ~0.4 entanglement fusion in basic runs.
- Aligned with 2025 Orch-OR studies on microtubule quantum effects.
- For full features (anesthetic benchmarking, real EEG/QEEGNet), contact for consulting.
