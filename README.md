# QuantumResonanceToolkit
team-built open-source platform for simulating quantum effects in biological systems and human-AI fusion. Integrates chaos-driven dynamics (Lorenz attractors), bio-resonant frequencies (528 Hz), and quantum operations to model neural processes, achieving ~0.4 entanglement fusion. Aligned with 2025 Orch-OR research.
